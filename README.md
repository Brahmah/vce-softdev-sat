# What could have been done better:
### Frontend
- API controller should have been implemented to handle all REST communication from the frontend to the backend consistently and handle auth in one place.
- CSS should have been far more consistent and less redundant.
- CSS classes should have been named more appropriately.
- Tailwind would have been a lot easier.
### Backend
- Classes should have been implemented to handle all CRUD operations on the database.
- Project structure should have been organized by controllers, models, and utils.
- Definitely should have used laravel.
- Middleware should have been implemented to handle all authentication and authorization.
- In general very unstructured.

Ultimately, this programme was created for a VCE Project Management course that has a significant software development component, and it is more than sufficient to pass the assessment requirements for that criterion. The software component was allocated very little resources by the course, as prevelant in the quality of this 'software solution'.

This was submitted on 28/7/2022, the repository will only be public once the SAT is graded. 
UPDATE: 98% nice, apparently had a small logic bug.
