# What could have been done better:
### Frontend
- API controller should have been implemented to handle all REST communication from the frontend to the backend consistently and handle auth in one place.
- CSS should have been far more consistent and less redundant.
- CSS classes should have been named more appropriately.
### Backend
- Classes should have been implemented to handle all CRUD operations on the database.
- Project structure should have been organized by controllers, models, and utils.
- Middleware should have been implemented to handle all authentication and authorization.
